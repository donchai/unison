Unison, a linux/windows program written-lead designed by Professor <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/">Benjamin C. Pierce</a> made available on https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/ to address source and destination machines two-way files synchronisation on specified folders in effect.

This shell script was written to facilitate unison scripted installation (after realising there are gaps to address virtual machine is ready for unison installation e.g. linraries and machine tuning) under a pair of newly deployed Azure Virtual Machines <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros#supported-distributions-and-versions">CentOS 8.2 distribution</a> at the time of writing this readme.
