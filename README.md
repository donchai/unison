# unison
Unison, a linux/windows program written-lead designed by Professor <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/">Benjamin C. Pierce</a> made available on https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/ to address source and destination machines two-way files synchronisation on specified folders in effect.

This shell script was written to facilitate unison scripted installation (after realising there is some gap to address how to make sure newly deployed VM is ready for synchronisation tasks) under a pair of newly deployed Azure Virtual Machines <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros#supported-distributions-and-versions">CentOS 8.2 distribution</a> at the time of writing this readme.
